/**** ORDER OF CODE EXECUTION: PRACTICE ****/

/** STRINGBUILDING **/

// 1. TODO: Re-order the lines of code below so that running the file produces these two
// lines of output:
// JAVA
// JAVASCRIPT
let word = "";
word = word + "JA";
word = word + "VA";
console.log(word);

word = word + "SC";
word = word + "RI";
word = word + "PT";
console.log(word);



// Run the file before moving on to ensure you get the expected result.

/** DATA MANIPULATION **/

// 2. TODO: Plan out the additional lines of code needed according to the following guidelines:
//    A) You will modify some existing numbers. The final sum in the console should be 445.
//    B) The sum should be calculated by adding all modified numbers and storing
//       it in a new variable. Print only that new variable.
//    C) Use the + and - operators to add and subtract numbers as required
//    D) All odd numbers should be made even by adding 1 to their value and
//       reassigning them to the same variable name without changing the original assignment.
//    E) All even numbers should be made odd by subtracting 5 from their value
//       and reassigning to the same variable without changing the original assignment.

// Add code where needed below, then test by running the file.

// IMPORTANT: Do not edit the 6 existing lines of code; add NEW lines of code only.

let num1 = 56;
let num2 = 121;
let num3 = 73;
let num4 = 24;
let num5 = 88;
let num6 = 95;

num1 = num1 - 5;
console.log(num1);
num2 = num2 + 1;
console.log(num2);
num3 = num3 + 1;
console.log(num3);
num4 = num4 - 5;
console.log(num4);
num5 = num5 - 5;
console.log(num5);
num6 = num6 + 1;
console.log(num6);


let finalSum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 + num6
console.log(finalSum);

// All done? Great job! Understanding how JavaScript executes and evaluates code is
// important. Keep these principles in mind as you solve future problems!

// TODO: Before you go... don't forget to make a git commit!
